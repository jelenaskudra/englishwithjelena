   - Change only the words inside the "quotes".
   - Keep the quotes, commas and brackets exactly where they are.
   - Inside a text, don't type a plain " character. Use «ёлочки» or ’ instead.
   - Words wrapped in *stars* get the yellow highlighter on the website.
   - An empty "" hides that thing (for example an empty whatsapp: "").

      flexTitle: "Почему структура «не жёсткая»?",
      flex: "Не всё стоит строго планировать заранее. Небольшие пробелы закрываем сразу, большие — попадают в план следующего занятия. Если пятиминутное повторение растягивается, потому что тема подзабылась, я потрачу на неё время — без чувства вины «мы же это уже прошли!». А если на разминке хочется рассказать длинную историю о выходных, поделиться радостью или пожаловаться на жизнь — я не перебью по таймеру, а подскажу нужные слова и конструкции, чтобы история стала частью урока."

Her lessons are both effective and enjoyable, and she creates a friendly and supportive atmosphere. With her help, I was able to improve my English quickly, gain confidence, and get admitted to the university I wanted to attend." },

Набрала более высокую оценку там, где и не думала. Спасибо вам за вашу работу! Без вас я бы даже такого уровня не достигла. Вы открыли мне другой английский, который приятно и интересно изучать, а не чувствовать страх, когда его видишь." },
